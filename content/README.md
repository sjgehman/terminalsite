## Future Commands

When you're ready to add these to your terminal, you'll need to:
1. Create command handlers for `blog` and `projects`
2. Add routing or display logic to show the markdown content
3. Add these commands to your terminal's available commands list

For now, this content serves as a foundation you can build on.
